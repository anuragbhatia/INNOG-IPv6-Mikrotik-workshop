# INNOG IPv6 Mikrotik Workshop

Objective here is to enable & encourage operators to deploy IPv6 with Mikrotik on the last mile networks. 
INNOG is Indian NOG and thus we are tilted towards whatever Indian Networks prefer to use. 

Tools and services we are making use of: 

1. Cloud player like Vultr to run Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router images for the lab
